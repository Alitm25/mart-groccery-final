This is a sample nest mart shop with ReactJs and NextJs. This project is a part of NAVAX College bootcamp final project which its developing trend begans from mid-July(Tir) to late August(Shahrivar).

In this project I used various up-to-date technologies of Front-end programming in all part of it. Below you can see the technology used:

- In the UI: SwipperJS, React toastify, tailwind,
- In API fetching: Axios, Tanstack Query, Strapi Swagger
- In form handling: React Hook form
- Other technologies: React Context, Inview Js, Rendering Strategy(SSR & CSR), TypeScript, NextJS routing and so forse.


This project has frequent features of a shopping website. Below you can observe some features of this website:

- Responsive at any screen size: By using tailwind css, this site has no issues in the matter of rendering on lower screen sizes.
- Live search**: By using RHF, you can search in the available products in the website with the header search bar. It is completely standard and have some performance features like Debouncing.
- Login and Register: In this website, you can register and place some orders. This procces is developed api base with JWT and modals. Both login and register forms validation and errot handling controlled by RHF and has no issue about it.
- Shopping basket and Order process: In this website, you can place order by adding some products to your basket. For better UX, I added a mini-basket in larger screens. Unfortunately, the coupon section is not working due to the lack of api resources.
- Account handling: In this Website, we have a account page which you can handle your account. Altough it is not complete, it's not without merit to say so.


This is some features that you can see in the Homepage, This page is also has several other pages wich I will explain below:

- Single-category**: At this page, we have all products of a single category. We have pagination and also price filtering for all categories. Becuase of the lack of api recourses, most of the categories have no products in it (which is handled), But some categories have a few of it. You can click on miniSlider after the banner part to see the page and products of the category.
- Single-product**: If you click on either each product title on mobile or products card eye logo (by hovering), you will redirect to the single-page page. In this page, you can see the detials of each product and the realated products of it.
- Your order: After adding some products to your basket, by clicking on the shopping-cart logo on the top right, you will redirect the your-order page. In this page, you can mange your orders such as remove and increase or decrease. You can also see the total prices. We have coupon section too buy as I metioned above, it doesn't work.
- checkout: After managing your order, you will go to the checkout page and confirm your order process. We have validation form and also coupun section again. The forms validation completely developed by RHF. For placing an order you have to register first.
- Account: As I mentioned above, we have account page which you can see it on the top right of the page by clicking on the account logo.
- About us and contact us: On the footer section, you can go to the about us and contact us page.
